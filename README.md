COSC346 Assignment 1
====================
Multi-Precision Integer
-----------------------

This is a multi-precision integer (BigInt) class.

It uses the basic quadratic time methods that are based off of schoolbook methods for performing arithmetic. These methods are the preferred way to implement mult-precision integers when their length is not too large. More efficient methods also have very complex implementations. 

Note that the project is currently written in C++, but is intended to be ported to Objective-C. As such, it is not always written in an idiomatic style.
